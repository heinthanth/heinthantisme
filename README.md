# Yes, it's me

Just a Jamstack ( <https://heinthantisme.pages.dev/> )'s source code with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). I think I wrote clean and performant codes.

## How to Run

To run this, u need `vips/vips.h`. That means u need to install [libvips](https://www.libvips.org/).

```shell script
npm i
npm run build:static
npm run start:static
```

Then, local site should be available at <http://localhost:3000>.
